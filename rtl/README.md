Committed all our works into the `main` branch.

Shermaine, Johan and Clemen made the necessery changes to the `pc`, `control_unit` and `alu` folders respectively, making all the required upgrades to sucessfully run the F1 Assembly Code. 

Alvi combined the three blocks to form the functional Single-Cycle RISC-V in `risc_v.sv` and wrote the testbench `risc_v_tb.cpp` to test the design with the F1 Assembly Code.
