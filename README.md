## Documentation for Project Phase I: Assembly Language Programme for F1 Starting Light Algorithm

During our first meeting on the 1st of December from 0900 to 1100, we discussed about the implementation of the F1 Starting Light Algorithm in Assembly. We compared two methods of implementation: (1) adding 2^n to a0 (where n is the state number); and (2) using lw to load data into a0. We decided to go with (2) as it was a more straightforward implementation. 

Our algorithm is as follows (a first cut produced from the meeting, though we agreed that all should go and do their own implementation): 

```
main
0 lw a1 8(zero)
4 jal C # begin subroutine
8 beq a1 a1 3C # end the program

mloop
c lw a0 0(zero) # 8b'0 also li is psuedo instruction, we store it in data mem
10 lw a0 1(zero) # 8b'1
14 lw a0 2(zero) # 8b'11
18 lw a0 3(zero) # 8b'111
1C lw a0 4(zero) # 8b'1111
20 lw a0 5(zero) # 8b'11111
24 lw a0 6(zero) # 8b'111111
28 lw a0 7(zero) # 8b'1111111
2C lw a0 8(zero) # 8b'11111111
30 nop
34 nop
38 beq a0, a1, x0 # branch back to original pc+4 (saved in rd)

iloop
3C nop
40 beq a1 a1 3C
```

This method would enable the algorithm to start immediately upon trigger/reset. Trigger and Reset have the same functionality given that they both start the program. No interrupts are implemented.

We worked out a schedule for the project, given below.
